# Welcome to Org mode

Welcome, and thanks for trying out Org mode. Making outlines in
  Org is very simple. It is just text! Just start typing.

## Moving around in our outline

Hello I am just an outline

## Lord of the Rings

My favorite scenes are (in this order)

1.  The attack of the Rohirrim
2.  Eowyn's fight with the witch king
    -   this was already my favorite scene in the book
    -   I really like Miranda Otto.
3.  Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
    -   on DVD only

He makes a really funny face when it happens.
But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
Important actors in this film are:

-   **Elijah Wood:** He plays Frodo
-   **Sean Austin:** He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
    him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

You can make words **bold**, *italic*, <span class="underline">underlined</span>, `code` and `verbatim`, and, if you must, <del>strike-through</del>.
